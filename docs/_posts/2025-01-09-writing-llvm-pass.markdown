### A Very Brief Post?

Yeah, I know it's been some time since the last (and basically only) post, and then I come here and write few lines in English. But this is an important topic to cover, since it's the base of a lot of things I have in mind to talk about.

The Portuguese version of this blog post demanded some time to write, and I judged it was more important to have it done before the English version, since there are very few Portuguese resources about the subject. So I'll update this page some day, when I have some time (and will) to translate that post.

For now, there's this very good tutorial at the [LLVM documentation](https://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMNewPMPass.html) that pretty much covers the topics I've covered there.

If, by some reason, I write the next blog post before translating it (the next one will be bilingual for sure), know that I will write about creating a transformation pass in LLVM for instrumenting a program.
