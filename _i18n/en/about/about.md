## Who am I?

Name's João Vitor Fröhlich, I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina (UDESC), and now I'm pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG). As you may note, I'm Brazilian.

Although I complain a lot about the field, I am a computer science enthusiast, specially in the fields of programming languages and theory, which curiously are the areas I most complain (probably because I'm more in touch with them). Also, I like to read, write (which is the reason I'm doing this blog), play some random computer games and have some crazy ideas (that don't make any sense) here and there.

## Contacts

As expected from a computer scientist, I'm sort of a low profile person, so I almost don't have social networks, but the ones that I have are listed below:
