# Welcome

Hello, and welcome to my personal blog. After some time doing boring unilateral conversations with my friends, I've decided that it would be more interesting to document many crazy ideas that I have and the discoveries I've found in Computer Science, in a place more suited to long texts. So, the main idea of this blog is to document here some texts on CC, both in English and Portuguese. However, a small notice: my English is not so good, so my English texts may have more grammatical errors than my Portuguese ones.
